     * <li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
     *     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
     *     {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
     *     should return {@code true} if and only if
     *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
     *     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
     *     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
     * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
     *     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the
     *     objects is modified.
     * <li>For any non-null reference value {@code x},
     *     {@code x.equals(null)} should return {@code false}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * An equivalence relation partitions the elements it operates on
     * into <i>equivalence classes</i>; all the members of an
     * equivalence class are equal to each other. Members of an
     * equivalence class are substitutable for each other, at least
     * for some purposes.

     * argument; {@code false} otherwise.

     * the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;

     * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
     * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).
     * <p>
     * In other words, under the reference equality equivalence
     * relation, each equivalence class only has a single element.
     * @apiNote It is generally necessary to override the {@link Version#hashCode hashCode}
     * method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
     * general contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which states
     * that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@link
     *     Version#equals(Object) equals} method, then calling the {@code
     *     hashCode} method on each of the two objects must produce the
     *     same integer result.

     *     according to the {@link Version#equals(Object) equals} method, then
     *     calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the two objects
     *     must produce distinct integer results.  However, the programmer
